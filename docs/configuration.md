# Configuration reference

For your first run, choose a [source guide](../README.md#start-here).
Use this page when you want to adjust an existing setup.

## Settings

Save reusable settings in YAML. Keep [credentials](model-access.md#credentials)
in the environment or `.env`.

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `trace` | Exactly one source; see the [source guides](../README.md#start-here). |
| `trace.max_traces` | Limit complete traces from a provider or native export. Unsupported for canonical JSONL, ATIF, and Gym rollouts. |
| `output_path` | YAML output file; defaults to `insights.yml`. Use `-` for stdout. |
| `model`, `api_base`, `max_tokens` | [Inference settings](model-access.md#choose-a-model). |
| `evidence_streams` | [Evidence streams and their prerequisites](evidence-streams.md). All five are enabled by default. |
| `code_base` | [Local agent source](#code-aware-review) to consult during candidate validation. |
| `confidence` | Run an optional [confidence review](#code-aware-review) of compiled insights against `code_base`. |
| `existing_insights` | Previous JSON or YAML insight collection to reconcile with this run. |

Relative paths resolve from the directory where you run the command.

## Code-aware review

Set `code_base` to consult your agent's local source using read-only search and file access.
Before compilation, the validator removes candidate problems contradicted by the code and retains
problems it cannot resolve from the repository. It cannot edit or execute your agent's code.

Set `confidence: true` alongside `code_base` to run an additional review after compilation.
This review investigates each final insight's behavior, root cause, scope, and implied remediation,
then assigns `confidence` as `low`, `med`, or `high`. Confidence remains unset when no codebase
tool call succeeds or the model cannot produce a valid structured response after retries, and the
review does not change severity. An unresolved validation response retains the candidate problem.

Confidence review is disabled by default. It makes additional model calls per insight: up to 12
investigation rounds and a final response. Each insight's context can include up to 100,000
characters of supporting traces plus tool results. Time and token usage depend on the model,
trace size, and investigation length. This is in addition to candidate validation when `code_base`
is supplied.

## One-run overrides

CLI options override individual YAML values. YAML uses underscores; CLI options use hyphens:

```bash
insight-agent --config config.yaml \
  --trace.max-traces 25 \
  --output-path investigation.yml
```

You can also run without YAML:

```bash
insight-agent --trace.filesystem.path traces.jsonl --max-tokens 16384
```

To enable confidence review, set both options in YAML:

```yaml
code_base: ../my-agent
confidence: true
```

Or enable it for a single run:

```bash
insight-agent --config config.yaml --code-base ../my-agent --confidence
```

Confidence review is disabled by default and adds source investigation calls.
Severity is assigned during final compilation without either option.

Use `insight-agent --help-all` for every option and its default.
Explicit CLI and YAML model settings take priority over [environment defaults](model-access.md#credentials).

## Repeat a run

Keep the configuration and a complete trace export to analyze the same input again.
Model-generated findings can vary between runs. Give each run its own `output_path`
when you want to compare results.

To update a previous collection, add these settings to your configuration:

```yaml
existing_insights: previous-insights.yml
output_path: updated-insights.yml
```

Trace Analyst reconciles old and new findings into a complete collection.
See [output behavior](results.md#saved-output) before using the files in a pipeline.
